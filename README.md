# Lip-Sync Video Generator

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of a text-to-video pipeline. It leverages the Coqui TTS library to generate speech from a given text and then uses the Wav2Lip model to synchronize that speech with the lip movements of a provided face image, resulting in a video where the person in the image appears to be speaking the input text.

## Features
Text-to-Speech (TTS): Uses Coqui TTS to convert input text into an audio file.

Lip Syncing: Employs Wav2Lip to generate a video where a face is synchronized with the generated audio.
